Irène Joliot-Curie won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of artificial radioactivity. To research her, I watched the documentary [Out from the Shadows: The Story of Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot Curie](https://www.kanopy.com/wayf/video/out-shadows-story-irene-joliot-curie-and-fre)[^1] and listened to a [Babes of Science podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/poncie-rutsch/babes-of-science/e/48910680) about her, as well as taking a tangentially-related visit to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford.


Some interesting facts about Irène Joliot-Curie:

* She's the daughter of Marie Curie and grew up in Paris.
* She did research with her husband, Frédéric Joliot-Curie. They shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for discovering that when an element is exposed to radiation, it can become radioactive itself even when the original source of radiation is removed. Previously, radiactive materials were very difficult and expensive to obtain, so this discovery enabled the use of radioactive materials in medicine and further scientific research.
* She and Frédéric participated in many other groundbreaking discoveries, but didn't interpet their results correctly to get the credit! 
  * In 1932 they showed they could produce a new type of radiation by shooting radiation from Polonium at other materials. James Chadwick realized what was being produced was neutrons, and he won the Nobel prize for discovering neutrons (previous the only known subatomic particles were protons and electrons). 
  * They did another experiment tracking particles in a cloud chamber and observed some electrons traveling in a different direction from the others. Turns out these were positrons, the antimatter equivalent of electrons. Carl David Anderson realized this and won the Nobel Prize.
  * They did experiments hitting Uranium with radiation and observed that smaller atoms were created. Turns out this was nuclear fission, and Otto Hahn later got the Nobel Prize for discovering it (side note: Lise Meitner got screwed by not being included).
* Irène and Frédéric worked to combat the Nazis duing World War II. Frédéric did research on nuclear fission and realized heavy water (water made with deuterium) was needed to create a controlled nuclear reaction. There was only one plant in the world that made most of the heavy water, so he had their entire supply shipped to him to keep it out of the hands of the Nazis. They kept it hidden throughout all of WWII.

In honor of Irène Joliot-Curie's contributions to particle physics, I visited the [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAC_National_Accelerator_Laboratory), the largest linear particle accelerator in the world at 2 miles long. It's not really related to the work Joliot-Curie did, but hey, still cool!

* SLAC was created in 1962 to research sub-atomic particles. It basically works by accelerating particles such as electrons and positrons to very high speeds and smashing them into detectors or other particles and seeing what happens.
* SLAC researchers won 3 Nobel Prizes for discovering 3 new types of particles -- quarks, the J/ψ meson, and the tau lepton.
* To discover further new particles, more powerful accelerators are needed, such as the Large Hadron Collidor. So SLAC has pivoted to use its accelerator for other things.
* One cool project we learned about is the [Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS)](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/overview). Electrons are shot down the linear accelerator while being "wiggled" side to side with magnets. The electrons give off X-rays via synchrotron radiation that are up to a billion times as powerful as normal X-rays. These X-rays are then used to take femtosecond-length pictures, which can capture "stop-motion animation" of extremely fast processes like chemical reactions in progress.

Here's a picture from the tour. The long silver tube on the left is the detector that records the images from the X-rays. The silver square with a small black hole just beyond the detector is where the electrons and X-rays come out from at the end of their 0.7-mile-long trip down the accelerator.

Irène Joliot-Curie would be impressed!
