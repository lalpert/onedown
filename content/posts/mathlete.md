The word "MATHLETE" was in the New York Times crossword puzzle for the first time, so I became a (grownup) mathlete for a day.

I went to a "Drunk Math" event in San Mateo. The event consists of going to a bar (along with 73 other people) and completing a high school math olympiad test, the [2019 AMC 12](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2019_AMC_12A_Problems). It's a 25-question math test with increasingly hard problems. Same rules apply as in the real contest (75 minutes, no calculators) with the addition that you get bonus points (equivalent of 1 extra question right) for each beer you drink during it.

I customized a t-shirt for the occasion:

Notes from the event:

* I'm almost exactly as good at math as I was when I took this test in 12th grade (well, slightly worse at math but slightly better at drinking)
* With a score of 107, I came in 17th out of 74 at the event! 
* People who know me may be more impressed that I finished 2 full beers in the 75 minute time span.
