There seems to be a culinary theme in this crossword:

* Emeril (21 Down: Former "Top Chef" judge)
* Ear of corn (57 Across: Something to shuck)
* Sole (25 Down: Fish order)
* Entree (43 Down: Primary course)
* Eat it up (7 Down: Savor the flattery)

My brother, my sister, and my sister's boyfriend came over to help experience all five of these at once by watching cooking videos by Emeril Lagasse on how to cook sole, cooking (an entree of) sole and corn, and eating it up! We decided to cook two sole recipes from Emeril's TV shows: Shrimp Stuffed Sole (videos [1](https://www.marthastewart.com/944932/sunday-dinner-shrimp-stuffed-sole), [2](https://www.marthastewart.com/1002109/sunday-dinner-shrimp-stuffed-sole), and [3](https://www.marthastewart.com/944934/sunday-dinner-baked-striped-bass)) and [Sweet Potato Crusted Sole](https://www.marthastewart.com/944836/sweet-potato-crusted-sole). My brother made us some Mexican-style corn as well to knock off another crossword word.

Some findings:

* Emeril Lagasse grew up in Fall River, Massachusetts -- just a few miles from where my Dad grew up!
* There were no recipes that came with the videos, we had to freestyle it according to Emeril's instructions. Everything came out pretty good!
* Emeril's version of "a little bit" didn't always match our own perceptions...

Here's the clip (no sound) of Emeril adding a "tiny bit" of butter to the vegetables:

And Daniel's re-enacment of Emeril adding a "little bit" of wine to the stock:

My brother (an Instagram professional) taught me about making slo-mo videos:

Here are the final results!

Then, all that was left to do was to "eat it up"! Or, as we say in my family, we snarfed it.
