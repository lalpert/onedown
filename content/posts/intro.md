Sometimes I do crossword puzzles and they reference movies, books, people, and things I don't know about. I thought of this idea to choose one crossword and learn about every reference in it, by reading a book, watching a movie, visiting a place, or going to an event.

I'm starting with the puzzle from Friday, February 8, the day I quit my job and had nothing better to do than come up with this project. 

If you're an NYT subscriber you can do the puzzle here: https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2019/02/08

Or read about it here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2019-02-08.html

The guidelines:

* I'll focus on words I didn't know, as well as some just for fun (mathlete, anyone? :-) )
* I'll learn about the word by going somewhere in the Bay Area if possible. Looking forward to exploring some of the lesser-known attractions in the area.
