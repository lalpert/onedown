The ready room is a room on an aircraft carrier where pilots wait before missions. For the phrase "ready room", I visited the aircraft carrier USS Hornet, and saw the ready room (as well as the rest of the ship).

The USS Hornet is an aircraft carrier that was use in World War II. It was decommissioned in 1970 and is now open as a [museum](https://www.uss-hornet.org/) in Alameda, CA. We went on a very informative tour that took us through the engine room, mess deck, hanger deck, berthing, catapult room, bomb elevators, and more. For anyone in the Bay Area at all interested in military history, I recommend visiting!

Some fun facts we learned aboard:

* After WWII, the USS Hornet was used for the space program. It recovered the astronauts of Apollo 11 after they returned from the first moon landing, as well as those from Apollo 12 a few months later.

* We took a tour of the engine room. The ship is propelled by underwater propellers at the back of the ship. The propellors are driven by two steam turbines. Steam is created onboard by desalinating sea water and heating it by burning crude oil, then sending it through large pipes into the turbines, which turn a gear that turns the propellors. Here are some pictures of one of the turbines, the gear box for the propellor, our tour guide, and the elaborate control panel to monitor the engine:

* There was a completely separate area of the ship for nuclear weapons and the people who worked on them (many of whome were civilians). They worked, slept, and ate in that area. The rest of the people on the ship couldn't enter that part of the ship or interact with the people who lived there.

* Airplanes couldn't take off from the ship under their own power alone, so they built a catapult system to accelerate planes up to a speed they could launch. It used compressed air to move pulleys which moved a cable that pulled a plane. Here's a picture of the pulley and cable system within the ship, and a model of how it worked:

* The first time a plane ever landed on a ship took place in the San Francisco Bay in 1911 when Eugene Burton Ely landed on the USS Pennsylvania.

And here's what we learned about the ready room:

* The ready room is where pilots stored their gear and spent time before they went on missions. It was also used as conference room and classroom for pilots, as well as a general hang-out space.
* On this ship, the ready room was 2 stories down from the flight deck to ensure it was underneath an armored steel deck to protect the pilots from bombs. To get the pilots with all their heavy equipment up to the top deck, they added an escalator from near the ready room all the way to the flight deck on top.
* There were 4 ready rooms on the USS Hornet, one for each squadron on board.
