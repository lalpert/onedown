Kofi Annan was Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1997-2006, and died in 2008 at age 80. For the word “Annan”, I watched the documentary [Kofi Annan: Center of the Storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MvR_tBMe3c), which followed Annan in his UN work from 2001-2002. And of course, I read his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan).

He also wrote a book about his experience at the UN. I haven't read it but [Bill Gates recommends it](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Interventions).

Some things I learned:

* The correct pronounciation of his last name rhymes with "cannon".
* He had a twin sister, and his middle name is Atta which means "twin".
* He went to MIT for business school.
* The movie showed how Annan worked to help rebuild Afghanistan after the US + NATO overthrew the Taliban post-September 11th. The UN doesn't have their own army or a large budget, so most of the work is convincing countries to contribute to causes.
* The movie also follows his work in helping East Timor (now know as Timor-Leste) gain independence from Indonesia.
* He was the UN's head of peacekeeping before he became Secretary-General. During that time, the Rwandan genocide happened (1994). One of his biggest regrets was not doing more to help at the time.
* He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 for his work at the UN, especially fighting HIV/AIDS and terrorism and stengthening the UN.
* Here's a clip from the movie showing how people apparently type at the UN:

* He helped create the Millenium Development Goals in 2000, aimed at reducing poverty and improving health throughout the world. Semi-related, I listened to this interesting [podcast](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/fixing-the-world-bang-for-the-buck-edition-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/) about how in 2015 an economist worked to figure out what the next set of world development goals should be.
* And finally, and most adorably, he was once on Sesame Street and taught the muppets how to all get along.
